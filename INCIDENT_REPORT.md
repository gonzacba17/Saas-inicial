---

## INCIDENT DETAILS

### What Happened?

Sensitive configuration files containing credential templates and development secrets were committed to the public Git repository and remain in the commit history.

### Files Compromised

1. **`.env.production.secure`**
   - **Exposure:** Committed in Git history (commit c4e5034 and earlier)
   - **Contents:** Production environment configuration template
   - **Sensitive Data:**
     - SECRET_KEY template
     - DATABASE_URL template structure
     - REDIS_PASSWORD template
     - MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN template
     - OPENAI_API_KEY template
     - BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY template
     - WEBHOOK_SECRET template
   - **Public Since:** Unknown - first appearance in commit history
   - **Current Status:** Modified in working directory, present in history

2. **`docker-compose.secrets.yml`**
   - **Exposure:** Committed in Git history (commits 44ea960, 7e31bb1)
   - **Contents:** Development secrets management configuration
   - **Sensitive Data:**
     - Vault dev token: `myroot`
     - LocalStack AWS credentials: `test/test`
     - Example database credentials in initialization script
     - Example JWT secret key
     - Example API keys
   - **Risk Level:** MEDIUM (development only, but indicates patterns)

### How Was It Discovered?

- Automated security scanning detected sensitive file patterns
- Manual audit confirmed exposure in Git history
- Files present despite `.gitignore` patterns

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause:**
- Files committed before being added to `.gitignore`
- Insufficient pre-commit validation

**Contributing Factors:**
1. No git-secrets or similar pre-commit hooks configured
2. No CI/CD secrets scanning in place
3. Template files not clearly marked as examples
4. Development tokens used in committed files

**Why .gitignore Failed:**
- Files were already tracked when `.gitignore` was updated
- Git continues tracking previously committed files
- `.gitignore` only affects untracked files

## AFFECTED SYSTEMS & CREDENTIALS

### Systems Potentially Compromised
- ‚úÖ Production Backend API
- ‚úÖ Production Database (PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ Production Cache (Redis)
- ‚úÖ Payment Gateway (MercadoPago)
- ‚úÖ AI Integration (OpenAI)
- ‚úÖ Backup System
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Environment (confirmed exposed)

### Credentials Requiring Rotation

| Credential | Exposure Level | Rotation Priority | Status |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| SECRET_KEY (JWT) | TEMPLATE | CRITICAL | ‚¨ú Pending |
| POSTGRES_PASSWORD | TEMPLATE | CRITICAL | ‚¨ú Pending |
| REDIS_PASSWORD | TEMPLATE | CRITICAL | ‚¨ú Pending |
| MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN | TEMPLATE | HIGH | ‚¨ú Pending |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | TEMPLATE | HIGH | ‚¨ú Pending |
| BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY | TEMPLATE | HIGH | ‚¨ú Pending |
| WEBHOOK_SECRET | TEMPLATE | HIGH | ‚¨ú Pending |
| Vault Dev Token | ACTUAL | MEDIUM | ‚¨ú Pending |

**Note:** Most exposed values are templates/placeholders. Risk assessment assumes potential for actual production values to have been used following these patterns.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

### Containment (0-1 hour)
- [x] Incident documented and reported
- [x] Repository access audit initiated
- [x] Remediation scripts created
- [ ] Team notification sent
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for suspicious activity

### Eradication (1-4 hours)
- [ ] Execute `remediate_secrets.sh` to remove files from Git history
- [ ] Force push to rewrite repository history
- [ ] Rotate all production credentials (see ROTATION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [ ] Update all deployment configurations
- [ ] Clear application caches/sessions

### Recovery (4-24 hours)
- [ ] Verify all services operational with new credentials
- [ ] Validate user authentication flows
- [ ] Confirm payment processing functionality
- [ ] Monitor error rates and logs
- [ ] Document configuration changes

---

## INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

### Logs Analysis
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- ".env.production.secure"
# Results: File present since commit c4e5034 (2025-09-30)

git log --all --full-history -- "docker-compose.secrets.yml"
# Results: File present since commit 44ea960 (2025-09-23)
```

### Access Logs Review
- **Repository:** Public access (GitHub)
- **Clone Count:** Unknown (GitHub doesn't expose for public repos)
- **Fork Count:** To be determined
- **Stars/Watchers:** To be determined
- **Assessment:** Assume public exposure and potential unauthorized access

### Suspicious Activity Indicators
- [ ] Unusual login attempts
- [ ] Unexpected API usage spikes
- [ ] Database access from unknown IPs
- [ ] MercadoPago transaction anomalies
- [ ] OpenAI API usage spikes

## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Wrong?
1. ‚ùå No pre-commit secret scanning
2. ‚ùå Template files committed without `.example` suffix
3. ‚ùå Insufficient developer training on secret management
4. ‚ùå No automated checks in CI/CD pipeline
5. ‚ùå `.gitignore` added after files were tracked

### What Went Right?
1. ‚úÖ Most exposed values were templates, not actual credentials
2. ‚úÖ Discovery happened through proactive security audit
3. ‚úÖ Clear `.gitignore` patterns existed
4. ‚úÖ Quick incident response and documentation
5. ‚úÖ Comprehensive remediation plan created

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate:**
   - Install git-secrets on all developer machines
   - Add pre-commit hooks to reject secrets
   - Template all sensitive config files with `.example` suffix

2. **Short-term:**
   - Implement secrets scanning in GitHub Actions
   - Mandate security training for all developers
   - Create secrets management runbook

3. **Long-term:**
   - Adopt centralized secrets management (Vault/AWS SM)
   - Implement quarterly secrets rotation policy
   - Regular security audits (monthly)
   - Automated compliance checking
